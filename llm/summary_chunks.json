Provisioning Patterns\nBL Yashvanth:\n\nProvisioned VMs primarily during late-night/early-morning hours (e.g., 04:50, 03:43, 02:16 UTC), suggesting automated or non-working-hour deployments.\nNo deprovisioning actions logged, which may indicate long-running instances or potential resource waste if VMs are idle.\nKiran:", "Provisioned VMs at varied times, including daytime (11:19 UTC) and early morning (04:52 UTC).\nHigher frequency of provisioning (15 instances) compared to other users, possibly indicating a development/testing workload.\nSanketh:\n\nProvisioned fewer VMs (7 instances), with timestamps spread across the day/night (e.g., 15:01, 23:39 UTC).\nRecent activity includes provisioning vm_80 and vm_77 in June 2025, suggesting ongoing projects.\n2. Job Execution (Run) Patterns\nCPU Utilization:\n\nMost jobs show high CPU usage (70\u201397%), indicating efficient resource utilization.\nNo \"failed\" jobs logged, but some runs have lower CPU (e.g., 68.2% for vm_71 by Sanketh), which might suggest underutilization or lightweight tasks.\nDuration:", "Long-running jobs (e.g., vm_65 by BL Yashvanth ran for 14 hours, vm_79 for 13 hours) hint at batch processing or training workloads.\nShort jobs (e.g., 1-hour runs for vm_72 by Kiran) may be tests or quick tasks.\nTime of Execution:\n\nNight-time Activity:\nBL Yashvanth's jobs often run overnight (e.g., 00:24\u201314:24 UTC for vm_65), aligning with automated pipelines or off-peak usage.\nKiran has fewer night-time jobs, with most activity during daytime hours.\nOverlap:\nSome VMs (e.g., vm_79 by BL Yashvanth) show frequent back-to-back jobs, possibly for iterative workloads like model training.\n3. Anomalies & Inefficiencies\nIdle VMs:\n\nNo deprovisioning logs suggest VMs may persist post-execution.

User-Specific Insights\nBL Yashvanth:\n\nFocused on a few VMs (vm_65, vm_79) with repetitive, high-CPU jobs. Likely running GPU-heavy workloads (e.g., AI training).\nRecommend checking for idle VMs (e.g., vm_69 last used in April).\nKiran:\n\nBroad usage across many VMs, possibly for diverse tasks.", "High provisioning rate but inconsistent usage (e.g., vm_56 used sporadically). Suggest cleanup of unused instances.\nSanketh:\n\nUses VMs for shorter, high-CPU bursts (e.g., vm_63 at 97.9%). May benefit from spot instances or auto-scaling.\n5. Recommendations\nCost Optimization:\n\nImplement auto-termination for idle VMs (e.g., no runs for >30 days).\nRight-size underutilized VMs (e.g., downgrade vm_57).\nAutomation:\n\nSchedule non-urgent jobs (like BL Yashvanth\u2019s night runs) during off-peak hours.\nMonitoring:\n\nAlert on sustained high CPU (>90%) to prevent bottlenecks.\nTrack provisioning-to-usage gaps (e.g., Kiran\u2019s vm_76 provisioned but no runs logged yet).\nResource Allocation:\n\nFor Sanketh\u2019s bursty workloads, consider Kubernetes or serverless options.\nSummary Table of Key Findings", "User\tProvisioning\tJob Patterns\tAnomalies\tRecommendations\nBL Yashvanth\tLate-night\tLong, high-CPU night jobs\tOrphaned vm_73?\tAuto-terminate idle VMs\nKiran\tFrequent, varied\tMixed short/long jobs\tLow CPU on vm_57\tClean up unused VMs\nSanketh\tModerate\tShort, high-CPU bursts\tvm_63 at 97.9% CPU\tUse spot instances for bursts\nFinal Note: No critical failures detected, but optimizing resource allocation could reduce costs and improve efficiency.

High Failure Rate in Workflows (User: Cormen)\nPattern Observed:\n\nThe user \"Cormen\" has a high failure rate in workflow executions, particularly on 2025-07-04.\nOut of 18 recorded executions, 15 failed (83% failure rate).\nOnly 3 executions succeeded (all of type \"workflow\").\nAnomalies & Inefficiencies:\n\nRepeated Failures: The same workflow executions (e.g., Local Workflow and workflow) fail repeatedly within short intervals.", "Long-Running Failed Job: One execution had an unusually long duration (187,542 seconds \u2248 52 hours) before failing. This suggests a resource exhaustion, deadlock, or infinite loop issue.\nRetry Behavior: The same workflows are executed multiple times in quick succession (e.g., between 16:50:58 and 18:01:33), indicating inefficient retry logic without proper error handling.\nPossible Causes:\n\nConfiguration Errors: Misconfigured workflows leading to repeated failures.\nResource Constraints: System may be running out of memory, CPU, or storage.\nDependency Failures: External services or data dependencies might be unavailable.\nBug in Workflow Logic: Possible infinite loop or unhandled edge cases.\n2. Suspicious Repeated Actions (User: Cormen)\nPattern Observed:", "The same action timestamps (2025-04-19T08:44:22, 2025-04-19T08:50:48, 2025-04-19T08:51:35) are repeated before every execution.\nThese actions seem automated or scripted, possibly indicating a misconfigured cron job or polling mechanism.\nAnomalies:\n\nThe timestamps are from April 2025, but the executions occur in July 2025, suggesting incorrect logging or timezone issues.\nCould be a bug in logging where the action timestamp is not updated correctly.\n3. Minimal Activity from \"Syed Admin\"\nPattern Observed:\n\nOnly two actions (no executions) recorded on 2025-07-02.\nNo workflow runs or failures logged.\nAnomalies:\n\nUnusually low activity compared to \"Cormen.\"\nCould be a service account or inactive user.\n4. Night-Time Activity\nAnalysis:", "Most executions occur between 16:50 and 18:01 UTC (late afternoon/evening in many time zones).\nNo late-night (00:00\u201306:00) activity, suggesting no automated batch jobs running during off-hours.\n5. Usage Gaps\nPattern Observed:\nNo recorded activity between 2025-04-19 and 2025-07-02 (over 2 months of inactivity).\nPossible explanations:\nLogging issues (missing data).\nSystem was unused during this period.\nTesting phase before July 2025 executions.\n6. Execution Duration Analysis\nShort Failures:\n\nMost failed jobs run for < 2,000 seconds (~33 minutes).\nSuggests early termination due to validation errors or timeouts.\nExtremely Long Failure:\n\nOne job ran for 187,542 seconds (~52 hours) before failing.\nIndicates a severe issue (e.g., deadlock, unresponsive service).\nRecommendations", "Investigate Failed Workflows:\n\nCheck logs for error messages in the failing workflows.\nValidate input data and dependencies.\nImplement better error handling and retry logic.\nFix Timestamp Issues:\n\nVerify why action timestamps from April 2025 appear before July 2025 executions.\nCheck for timezone or logging bugs.\nMonitor Resource Usage:\n\nInvestigate if CPU/memory/disk constraints caused the long-running failure.\nConsider auto-scaling or resource limits.\nReview Automation Logic:\n\nIf workflows are auto-retrying too aggressively, implement exponential backoff.\nEnsure idempotency in workflows to prevent duplicate executions.\nAudit User Activity:\n\nCheck if \"Syed Admin\" is a necessary account (or if it\u2019s a service account).", "Verify if \"Cormen\" is a human user or automated system (given the repeated actions).\nCheck for Logging Gaps:\n\nInvestigate why there\u2019s no activity for over 2 months (missing logs?).\nSummary\nMajor Issue: High failure rate in workflows, especially a 52-hour failed job.\nSuspicious Behavior: Repeated actions with incorrect timestamps.\nLow Activity: Minimal usage from \"Syed Admin\" and a long inactivity gap.\nAction Items: Debug workflows, fix logging, optimize retries, and monitor resources."]
