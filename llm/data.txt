1. Overview of Activity
Users: Jeevan, Kishan, Sharath
Total VMs Provisioned: 20 (across all users)
Activity Period: April 16, 2025, to July 5, 2025 (~2.5 months)
2. Key Patterns and Observations
a. VM Provisioning Trends
Jeevan:
Provisioned 5 VMs (vm_87, vm_88, vm_95, vm_98, vm_103).
Most provisioning occurred in April and June, with a gap in May except for vm_95 on May 4.
Night-time provisioning: vm_87 (00:21 UTC), vm_95 (23:05 UTC).
Kishan:
Provisioned 9 VMs (vm_86, vm_89, vm_90, vm_91, vm_92, vm_94, vm_96, vm_97, vm_99, vm_104).
Frequent provisioning in April and May, with some in June.
Night-time provisioning: vm_89 (01:02 UTC), vm_96 (23:19 UTC), vm_104 (00:47 UTC).
Sharath:
Provisioned 6 VMs (vm_85, vm_93, vm_100, vm_101, vm_102).
Most provisioning in May and June.
Night-time provisioning: vm_93 (23:42 UTC).
b. VM Usage and CPU Patterns
High-CPU Usage Instances:
vm_96 (Kishan): Peaked at 68.1% CPU (April 23–24).
vm_102 (Sharath): Peaked at 68.0% CPU (May 7).
vm_89 (Kishan): Frequently high CPU (e.g., 61.5%, 61.9%, 66.8%).
vm_98 (Jeevan): Sustained high CPU (e.g., 65.7%, 64.0%).
Low-CPU Usage Instances:
vm_92 (Kishan): 32.4% CPU (May 24).
vm_97 (Kishan): 30.2% CPU (May 27–28).
vm_88 (Jeevan): 32.3% CPU (June 28).
c. Night-Time Activity
Jeevan:
Long-running jobs at night:
vm_98 ran from 02:24–15:24 UTC (13 hours, avg CPU 51.1%) on April 18.
vm_98 ran from 21:24–11:24 UTC (14 hours, avg CPU 65.7%) on May 10–11.
Kishan:
Frequent night-time jobs:
vm_89 ran from 19:24–07:24 UTC (12 hours, avg CPU 35.8%) on April 29–30.
vm_104 ran from 21:24–04:24 UTC (7 hours, avg CPU 44.5%) on May 28–29.
Sharath:
Some night-time runs:
vm_102 ran from 22:24–14:24 UTC (16 hours, avg CPU 59.3%) on June 14–15.
d. Potential Inefficiencies
Underutilized VMs:
vm_92 (Kishan): Only one run at 32.4% CPU.
vm_97 (Kishan): Multiple runs below 40% CPU.
vm_88 (Jeevan): Low CPU usage (32.3%–58.4%).
Overlapping Runs:
Kishan’s vm_89 had overlapping runs on April 26 (06:24–10:24 and 06:24–15:24).
Sharath’s vm_101 and vm_100 overlapped on May 22 (19:24–23:24).
Long Idle Periods:
vm_87 (Jeevan): Provisioned April 16, first run on April 30 (14-day gap).
vm_93 (Sharath): Provisioned May 5, first run on April 26 (used before provisioning? Possible log inconsistency).
High CPU Variability:
vm_98 (Jeevan): CPU fluctuates between 33.3% and 65.7%, suggesting inconsistent workloads.
e. Anomalies
Pre-provisioning Usage:
vm_93 (Sharath): Run on April 26–27 but provisioned on May 5 (log inconsistency).
Short-Lived Jobs:
vm_88 (Jeevan): Run for just 1 hour on June 28 (possibly failed or test job).
vm_97 (Kishan): Multiple short runs (<4 hours).
3. Recommendations
Optimize VM Utilization:
Decommission or downsize underutilized VMs (vm_92, vm_97, vm_88).
Consolidate workloads on fewer instances where possible.
Investigate Night-Time Activity:
Verify if long night-time jobs are scheduled tasks or ad-hoc (could be optimized for cost).
Log Consistency Checks:
Audit timestamps for discrepancies (e.g., vm_93 used before provisioning).
Monitor High-CPU Instances:
Check if peak CPU usage causes performance issues (e.g., vm_96, vm_102).
Cost-Saving Opportunities:

Use auto-scaling for variable workloads (e.g., vm_98).
Schedule non-critical jobs during off-peak hours.
4. Summary
Jeevan: Mostly stable, but some underutilized VMs and high CPU spikes.
Kishan: Highest number of VMs, with underutilization and overlapping runs.
Sharath: Log inconsistencies and variable CPU usage.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for NVIDIA
1. Provisioning Patterns
BL Yashvanth:

Provisioned VMs primarily during late-night/early-morning hours (e.g., 04:50, 03:43, 02:16 UTC), suggesting automated or non-working-hour deployments.
No deprovisioning actions logged, which may indicate long-running instances or potential resource waste if VMs are idle.
Kiran:

Provisioned VMs at varied times, including daytime (11:19 UTC) and early morning (04:52 UTC).
Higher frequency of provisioning (15 instances) compared to other users, possibly indicating a development/testing workload.
Sanketh:

Provisioned fewer VMs (7 instances), with timestamps spread across the day/night (e.g., 15:01, 23:39 UTC).
Recent activity includes provisioning vm_80 and vm_77 in June 2025, suggesting ongoing projects.
2. Job Execution (Run) Patterns
CPU Utilization:

Most jobs show high CPU usage (70–97%), indicating efficient resource utilization.
No "failed" jobs logged, but some runs have lower CPU (e.g., 68.2% for vm_71 by Sanketh), which might suggest underutilization or lightweight tasks.
Duration:

Long-running jobs (e.g., vm_65 by BL Yashvanth ran for 14 hours, vm_79 for 13 hours) hint at batch processing or training workloads.
Short jobs (e.g., 1-hour runs for vm_72 by Kiran) may be tests or quick tasks.
Time of Execution:

Night-time Activity:
BL Yashvanth's jobs often run overnight (e.g., 00:24–14:24 UTC for vm_65), aligning with automated pipelines or off-peak usage.
Kiran has fewer night-time jobs, with most activity during daytime hours.
Overlap:
Some VMs (e.g., vm_79 by BL Yashvanth) show frequent back-to-back jobs, possibly for iterative workloads like model training.
3. Anomalies & Inefficiencies
Idle VMs:

No deprovisioning logs suggest VMs may persist post-execution. For example:
vm_73 (provisioned 2025-06-10) had runs in April but no recent activity, possibly orphaned.
vm_81 by Kiran was provisioned in April but last used in June—check if it’s still needed.
Underutilized Instances:

vm_57 by Kiran had runs with CPU as low as 68.6%, which may not justify the VM’s cost.
Sanketh’s vm_71 had a run at 68.2% CPU, suggesting potential overallocation.
High Utilization Spikes:

vm_59 by Kiran hit 96.7% CPU, risking performance bottlenecks.
vm_63 by Sanketh reached 97.9% CPU—monitor for throttling.
4. User-Specific Insights
BL Yashvanth:

Focused on a few VMs (vm_65, vm_79) with repetitive, high-CPU jobs. Likely running GPU-heavy workloads (e.g., AI training).
Recommend checking for idle VMs (e.g., vm_69 last used in April).
Kiran:

Broad usage across many VMs, possibly for diverse tasks.
High provisioning rate but inconsistent usage (e.g., vm_56 used sporadically). Suggest cleanup of unused instances.
Sanketh:

Uses VMs for shorter, high-CPU bursts (e.g., vm_63 at 97.9%). May benefit from spot instances or auto-scaling.
5. Recommendations
Cost Optimization:

Implement auto-termination for idle VMs (e.g., no runs for >30 days).
Right-size underutilized VMs (e.g., downgrade vm_57).
Automation:

Schedule non-urgent jobs (like BL Yashvanth’s night runs) during off-peak hours.
Monitoring:

Alert on sustained high CPU (>90%) to prevent bottlenecks.
Track provisioning-to-usage gaps (e.g., Kiran’s vm_76 provisioned but no runs logged yet).
Resource Allocation:

For Sanketh’s bursty workloads, consider Kubernetes or serverless options.
Summary Table of Key Findings
User	Provisioning	Job Patterns	Anomalies	Recommendations
BL Yashvanth	Late-night	Long, high-CPU night jobs	Orphaned vm_73?	Auto-terminate idle VMs
Kiran	Frequent, varied	Mixed short/long jobs	Low CPU on vm_57	Clean up unused VMs
Sanketh	Moderate	Short, high-CPU bursts	vm_63 at 97.9% CPU	Use spot instances for bursts
Final Note: No critical failures detected, but optimizing resource allocation could reduce costs and improve efficiency. Further investigation into unlogged deprovisioning events is advised.

Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Western Digital
1. Provisioning Patterns
User: Cormen

Provisioned 7 instances (instancegcp1 to instancegcp7) between April 19, 2025, and July 3, 2025.
Clustered provisioning events:
April 19, 2025: 3 instances within 7 minutes (instancegcp1, instancegcp2, instancegcp3).
July 3, 2025: 3 instances within 2 minutes (instancegcp4, instancegcp6, instancegcp7).
Observation: Potential bulk provisioning for a specific workload or testing. Could indicate inefficient resource allocation if instances are underutilized afterward.
User: Syed Admin

Provisioned apps-group on July 2, 2025 (single instance).
Observation: Might be for a different use case (e.g., application deployment).
2. Execution Failures (Workflows)
All executions on July 4, 2025, failed except two (complete status).
12 failed executions (10 workflow, 2 Local Workflow), with durations ranging from 434s to 187,542s (~52 hours).
Pattern: Failures occurred in quick succession (e.g., 4 failures within 9 minutes starting at 17:52:58).
Possible Causes:
Systemic issue (e.g., dependency failure, misconfiguration).
Resource exhaustion (high CPU usage observed in other instances around the same time).
Code/script errors in workflows.
3. Instance Utilization (CPU Patterns)
High CPU Usage Instances:

instancegcp2: Peaked at 73.1% (May 23) and 75.0% (June 18).
instancegcp4: Peaked at 72.6% (June 8–9) and 69.9% (May 17).
instancegcp6: Peaked at 71.3% (May 23) and 67.6% (June 26).
Observation: These instances are consistently highly utilized. May need scaling or optimization.
Low CPU Usage Instances:

instancegcp7: Often below 50% (e.g., 37.4% on May 14).
instancegcp3: Fluctuates (low: 37.4%, high: 75.0%).
Observation: Potential over-provisioning or idle resources.
Night-Time Activity:

Instances like instancegcp1, instancegcp3, and instancegcp6 frequently run overnight (e.g., May 19 19:24 to May 20 10:24).
Implication: Could be batch jobs or automated tasks. Verify if these are necessary or if scheduling can be optimized.
4. Long-Running Executions
Outlier: One execution ran for 187,542s (~52 hours) on July 4 before failing.
Root Cause Needed: Check if this was intentional (e.g., data processing) or a hung process.
5. Time Gaps and Inefficiencies
Gaps in Activity:

No run logs for instancegcp5 (missing or unused instance?).
Long periods without activity for some instances (e.g., instancegcp7 has gaps in June).
Recommendation: Audit unused instances for cost savings.
Inefficient Scheduling:

Overlapping runs (e.g., instancegcp1 and instancegcp3 on May 7).
Suggestion: Consolidate workloads to reduce concurrent resource usage.
6. Anomalies
Sudden CPU Spikes:
instancegcp2 hit 75.0% on June 18 for 2 hours.
Investigate: Possible rogue process or sudden load.
Consistent Failures:
All workflows failed on July 4. Correlate with system logs.
Recommendations
Debug Workflow Failures:

Check logs for the July 4 failures to identify common causes (e.g., timeout, resource limits).
Implement retries or alerts for long-running workflows.
Right-Size Resources:

Scale down underutilized instances (e.g., instancegcp7).
Scale up high-usage instances (instancegcp2, instancegcp4).
Clean Up Unused Instances:

Verify if instancegcp5 exists and terminate if unused.
Audit other instances with sporadic activity.
Optimize Scheduling:

Stagger batch jobs to avoid CPU contention.
Use auto-scaling for variable workloads.
Monitor Night-Time Activity:

Ensure overnight jobs are necessary and efficient.
Alerting for Anomalies:

Set thresholds for CPU spikes (>70%) and prolonged executions.
Summary
Efficiency Issues: Over-provisioning, idle instances, and workflow failures.
Performance Hotspots: instancegcp2, instancegcp4, and instancegcp6 need monitoring.
Action Items: Debug failures, optimize scheduling, and rightsize resources.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for INTEL
1. General Observations
The logs cover activities from April 16, 2025, to June 5, 2025, for three users: Jeevan, Kishan, and Sharath.
All logged activities are of type "action" (no explicit job executions or failures are recorded).
The data does not include details about the nature of the actions (e.g., login, resource access, job execution), making it harder to infer specific inefficiencies or anomalies.
2. Temporal Patterns
a) Night-Time Activity
Jeevan:
April 16, 2025: Action at 00:21 (12:21 AM) and 23:05 (11:05 PM) on May 4.
Suggests occasional late-night or early-morning work.
Kishan:
Actions at 23:36 (11:36 PM) on April 20, 01:02 (1:02 AM) on April 26, 23:19 (11:19 PM) on April 29, and 00:47 (12:47 AM) on May 28.
Frequent night-time activity, possibly indicating irregular working hours or automated tasks.
Sharath:
Actions at 23:42 (11:42 PM) on May 5 and 06:03 (6:03 AM) / 07:16 (7:16 AM) on June 5.
Early morning or late-night activity, possibly for maintenance or global collaboration.
b) Usage Gaps
Jeevan:
Long gaps between actions:
April 16 to May 4 (18 days),
May 4 to June 4 (31 days).
Could indicate sporadic usage or inactivity.
Kishan:
More consistent activity but with gaps like:
April 17 to April 20 (3 days),
April 26 to April 29 (3 days),
May 4 to May 20 (16 days).
Sharath:
Large gaps:
April 23 to May 5 (12 days),
May 5 to June 4 (30 days).
Activity spikes on June 4–5 (3 actions in 15 hours).
3. Potential Anomalies
Clustering of Actions:
All three users had actions on June 4–5, 2025:
Jeevan: June 4 (13:58, 18:47),
Kishan: June 4 (16:44), June 5 (09:08),
Sharath: June 4 (15:54), June 5 (06:03, 07:16).
Could indicate a coordinated event (e.g., system update, project deadline).
May 4, 2025:
Jeevan (23:05) and Kishan (15:02, 17:55) were active on the same day.
Sharath's next action was May 5 (23:42), possibly related.
4. Inefficiencies or Oddities
Low Activity Density:
Only 16 actions across 3 users over ~2 months suggests underutilization or missing logs.
No Failed Jobs:
No records of failures, which could mean either perfect reliability or lack of logging for errors.
Time Zone Considerations:
Timestamps are in UTC. Night-time activity could be normal working hours in other time zones (e.g., Asia).
5. Recommendations
Enrich Logs:
Add details like action type (login, job start/end, resource access) to better analyze patterns.
Include success/failure status for jobs.
Investigate Gaps:
Check if long inactivity periods (e.g., Jeevan’s 31-day gap) are expected or indicate issues.
Night-Time Activity:
Verify if late-night actions are manual (e.g., overtime) or automated (e.g., cron jobs).
Correlated Activity:
Review June 4–5 actions to determine if they reflect planned work or an incident response.
Summary
Patterns: Night-time activity, sporadic usage, clustered actions on specific dates.
Anomalies: Long inactivity gaps, possible unlogged failures.
Next Steps: Improve logging granularity, investigate UTC offsets, and validate expected usage patterns.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for NVIDIA
1. Overview of Activity Patterns
The logs show activity from three users: BL Yashvanth, Kiran, and Sanketh between April 2025 and June 2025.

Kiran is the most active user with 17 logged actions.
BL Yashvanth has 6 actions.
Sanketh has 7 actions.
2. Temporal Patterns & Anomalies
a) Night-Time Activity (Non-Standard Hours)
BL Yashvanth has 3 out of 6 actions during late-night/early-morning hours:

2025-05-23T02:16:32
2025-06-17T04:50:55
2025-06-23T03:43:59
(Possible timezone difference? Or irregular working hours.)
Kiran has 7 out of 17 actions between 3 AM and 7 AM UTC:

E.g., 2025-04-05T05:50:14, 2025-04-19T03:38:59, 2025-05-20T04:52:45
Could indicate automated jobs, global team coordination, or shift work.
Sanketh has 3 out of 7 actions at night:

2025-04-04T23:39:35
2025-04-15T04:33:59
2025-06-24T07:48:27
b) Usage Gaps (Periods of Inactivity)
BL Yashvanth has long gaps between actions:

April 8 → May 8 (30 days)
May 23 → June 10 (18 days)
Possible vacation, role change, or reduced workload.
Sanketh has sporadic activity:

April 15 → May 8 (23 days gap)
May 19 → June 22 (34 days gap)
Could indicate part-time work or project-based engagement.
Kiran is more consistent but has smaller gaps (e.g., 10 days between some actions).

c) Clustering of Actions (Possible Batch Jobs)
Kiran has two actions within ~2.5 hours on 2025-04-19:
03:38:59 and 06:04:56
Could indicate job retries or scheduled workflows.
3. Potential Inefficiencies & Anomalies
No Failed Jobs Logged

All entries are "type": "action"—no explicit failures.
If failures are not logged, this could hide inefficiencies.
Irregular Work Patterns

Some users (e.g., BL Yashvanth) have long inactivity periods, which may suggest underutilization.
Others (Kiran) have frequent early-morning actions, possibly indicating manual interventions that could be automated.
Possible Timezone Mismatch

If users are expected to work in a specific timezone, late-night activity could indicate remote work or automation.
4. Recommendations
Log More Detailed Job Statuses

Add "status": "success/failed" to detect failures.
Track durations if these are job executions.
Investigate Night-Time Activity

If automated, ensure proper scheduling.
If manual, assess workload distribution.
Monitor Long Inactivity Periods

Check if users need re-engagement or if tasks are stalled.
Automate Frequent Early-Morning Actions

If Kiran’s 3 AM actions are manual, automation could improve efficiency.
Summary
Kiran is the most active, often working early mornings.
BL Yashvanth has long gaps in activity.
Sanketh’s usage is sporadic.
No failures logged—consider enhancing logging.
Possible automation opportunities for recurring actions.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Texas Instruments
1. User Activity Patterns
Jack:

Actions are sporadic, with activity on April 16, 17, and 25.
All actions occur in the early morning (4:34 AM - 7:38 AM UTC).
On April 25, there are two actions within 1.5 minutes, suggesting a possible automated or rapid manual process.
Mike:

All activity is concentrated on April 19.
Actions occur in quick succession (5:22 AM - 5:36 AM UTC), with only a few minutes between them.
This could indicate a burst of activity (e.g., debugging, batch job execution).
Syed Umair:

Most active user, with actions spread across April, May, June, and July.
Daytime activity (8:36 AM - 3:56 PM UTC) on April 7, but also early morning (4:36 AM UTC) on April 11.
Late-night activity (12:23 AM UTC) on May 20.
High-frequency actions on June 9 (three actions within 14 minutes), suggesting an intensive task.
2. Anomalies & Potential Issues
Irregular Time Gaps:

Jack has no activity between April 17 and 25, an 8-day gap.
Mike has only one day of activity (April 19).
Syed Umair has long inactivity periods, such as between April 11 and May 7 (26 days).
Unusual Hours:

Jack and Mike consistently work in the early morning (4-7 AM UTC), which may indicate automated jobs or non-standard working hours (e.g., maintenance tasks).
Syed Umair’s late-night activity (May 20, 12:23 AM UTC) could be after-hours work or a potential security concern (e.g., unauthorized access).
High-Frequency Actions:

Jack (April 25): Two actions in 1.5 minutes.
Mike (April 19): Three actions in 14 minutes.
Syed Umair (June 9): Three actions in 14 minutes.
These could be automated scripts, bulk operations, or system errors causing repeated attempts.
3. Potential Inefficiencies
Underutilization:

Mike only appears once in logs (April 19).
Jack has very few actions (4 total).
If these are human users, they may be underutilized or relying on automation.
Possible Automation vs. Human Activity:

Jack and Mike’s early-morning actions suggest scheduled jobs (e.g., backups, ETL processes).
Syed Umair’s spread-out activity suggests human-driven work (e.g., debugging, manual tasks).
4. Recommendations
Investigate Early-Morning/Late-Night Activity:

Verify if Jack and Mike’s actions are automated (e.g., cron jobs).
Check if Syed Umair’s 12:23 AM action was legitimate (security audit).
Monitor High-Frequency Actions:

Look for failed retries or redundant executions (e.g., if actions are failing and retrying).
Optimize User Engagement:

If Jack and Mike are human users, assess why their activity is minimal.
If automated, consider consolidating jobs to reduce overhead.
Improve Logging:

Add action details (e.g., success/failure, job type) to distinguish between automated and manual work.
Summary of Findings
User	Activity Pattern	Anomalies	Possible Causes
Jack	Early morning, sparse activity	8-day gap, rapid actions	Automated jobs, low usage
Mike	Single burst of early-morning actions	Only one active day	Batch job, underutilized user
Syed	Mixed hours, some high-frequency	Late-night action, long gaps	Human work, possible security check
Next Steps:

Audit automation scripts (Jack & Mike).
Review access logs for Syed’s late-night action.
Enhance logging to capture more context.


Analysis of Tenant Activity Logs for Western Digital
1. High Failure Rate in Workflows (User: Cormen)
Pattern Observed:

The user "Cormen" has a high failure rate in workflow executions, particularly on 2025-07-04.
Out of 18 recorded executions, 15 failed (83% failure rate).
Only 3 executions succeeded (all of type "workflow").
Anomalies & Inefficiencies:

Repeated Failures: The same workflow executions (e.g., Local Workflow and workflow) fail repeatedly within short intervals.
Long-Running Failed Job: One execution had an unusually long duration (187,542 seconds ≈ 52 hours) before failing. This suggests a resource exhaustion, deadlock, or infinite loop issue.
Retry Behavior: The same workflows are executed multiple times in quick succession (e.g., between 16:50:58 and 18:01:33), indicating inefficient retry logic without proper error handling.
Possible Causes:

Configuration Errors: Misconfigured workflows leading to repeated failures.
Resource Constraints: System may be running out of memory, CPU, or storage.
Dependency Failures: External services or data dependencies might be unavailable.
Bug in Workflow Logic: Possible infinite loop or unhandled edge cases.
2. Suspicious Repeated Actions (User: Cormen)
Pattern Observed:

The same action timestamps (2025-04-19T08:44:22, 2025-04-19T08:50:48, 2025-04-19T08:51:35) are repeated before every execution.
These actions seem automated or scripted, possibly indicating a misconfigured cron job or polling mechanism.
Anomalies:

The timestamps are from April 2025, but the executions occur in July 2025, suggesting incorrect logging or timezone issues.
Could be a bug in logging where the action timestamp is not updated correctly.
3. Minimal Activity from "Syed Admin"
Pattern Observed:

Only two actions (no executions) recorded on 2025-07-02.
No workflow runs or failures logged.
Anomalies:

Unusually low activity compared to "Cormen."
Could be a service account or inactive user.
4. Night-Time Activity
Analysis:
Most executions occur between 16:50 and 18:01 UTC (late afternoon/evening in many time zones).
No late-night (00:00–06:00) activity, suggesting no automated batch jobs running during off-hours.
5. Usage Gaps
Pattern Observed:
No recorded activity between 2025-04-19 and 2025-07-02 (over 2 months of inactivity).
Possible explanations:
Logging issues (missing data).
System was unused during this period.
Testing phase before July 2025 executions.
6. Execution Duration Analysis
Short Failures:

Most failed jobs run for < 2,000 seconds (~33 minutes).
Suggests early termination due to validation errors or timeouts.
Extremely Long Failure:

One job ran for 187,542 seconds (~52 hours) before failing.
Indicates a severe issue (e.g., deadlock, unresponsive service).
Recommendations
Investigate Failed Workflows:

Check logs for error messages in the failing workflows.
Validate input data and dependencies.
Implement better error handling and retry logic.
Fix Timestamp Issues:

Verify why action timestamps from April 2025 appear before July 2025 executions.
Check for timezone or logging bugs.
Monitor Resource Usage:

Investigate if CPU/memory/disk constraints caused the long-running failure.
Consider auto-scaling or resource limits.
Review Automation Logic:

If workflows are auto-retrying too aggressively, implement exponential backoff.
Ensure idempotency in workflows to prevent duplicate executions.
Audit User Activity:

Check if "Syed Admin" is a necessary account (or if it’s a service account).
Verify if "Cormen" is a human user or automated system (given the repeated actions).
Check for Logging Gaps:

Investigate why there’s no activity for over 2 months (missing logs?).
Summary
Major Issue: High failure rate in workflows, especially a 52-hour failed job.
Suspicious Behavior: Repeated actions with incorrect timestamps.
Low Activity: Minimal usage from "Syed Admin" and a long inactivity gap.
Action Items: Debug workflows, fix logging, optimize retries, and monitor resources.
